## Letter Case Permutation

Given a string S, we can transform every letter individually to be lowercase or uppercase to create another string.

Return *a list of all possible strings we could create*. You can return the output in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: S = "a1b2"
Output: ["a1b2","a1B2","A1b2","A1B2"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: S = "3z4"
Output: ["3z4","3Z4"]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: S = "12345"
Output: ["12345"]
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: S = "0"
Output: ["0"]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `S` will be a string with length between `1` and `12`.
- `S` will consist only of letters or digits.

## Container With Most Water

Given `n` non-negative integers `a1, a2, ..., an` , where each represents a point at coordinate `(i, ai)`. `n` vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line `i` is at `(i, ai)` and `(i, 0)`. Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: height = [4,3,2,1,4]
Output: 16
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: height = [1,2,1]
Output: 2
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == height.length`
- `2 <= n <= 3 * 104`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 3 * 104`
