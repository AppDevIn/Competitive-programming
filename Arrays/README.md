## Max Consecutive Ones

Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s.
    The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
```



**Note:**

- The input array will only contain `0` and `1`.
- The length of input array is a positive integer and will not exceed 10,000







## Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits

Given an array `nums` of integers, return how many of them contain an **even number** of digits.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [12,345,2,6,7896]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
12 contains 2 digits (even number of digits). 
345 contains 3 digits (odd number of digits). 
2 contains 1 digit (odd number of digits). 
6 contains 1 digit (odd number of digits). 
7896 contains 4 digits (even number of digits). 
Therefore only 12 and 7896 contain an even number of digits.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [555,901,482,1771]
Output: 1 
Explanation: 
Only 1771 contains an even number of digits.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 500`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`







## Squares of a Sorted Array

Given an array of integers `A` sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number, also in sorted non-decreasing order.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]
```

 

**Note:**

1. `1 <= A.length <= 10000`
2. `-10000 <= A[i] <= 10000`
3. `A` is sorted in non-decreasing order.





## Duplicate Zeros

Given a fixed length array `arr` of integers, duplicate each occurrence of zero, shifting the remaining elements to the right.

Note that elements beyond the length of the original array are not written.

Do the above modifications to the input array **in place**, do not return anything from your function.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,0,2,3,0,4,5,0]
Output: null
Explanation: After calling your function, the input array is modified to: [1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,3]
Output: null
Explanation: After calling your function, the input array is modified to: [1,2,3]
```

 

**Note:**

1. `1 <= arr.length <= 10000`
2. `0 <= arr[i] <= 9`





## Merge Sorted Array

Given two sorted integer arrays *nums1* and *nums2*, merge *nums2* into *nums1* as one sorted array.

**Note:**

- The number of elements initialized in *nums1* and *nums2* are *m* and *n* respectively.
- You may assume that *nums1* has enough space (size that is **equal** to *m* + *n*) to hold additional elements from *nums2*.

**Example:**

```
Input:
nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
nums2 = [2,5,6],       n = 3

Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `-10^9 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^9`
- `nums1.length == m + n`
- `nums2.length == n`



## Remove Element

Given an array *nums* and a value *val*, remove all instances of that value [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** with O(1) extra memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

**Example 1:**

```
Given nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3,

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Given nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2,

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 1, 3, 0, and 4.

Note that the order of those five elements can be arbitrary.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```

**Clarification:**

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

```
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeElement(nums, val);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```

# Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Given a sorted array *nums*, remove the duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each element appears only *once* and returns the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** with O(1) extra memory.

**Clarification:**

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means a modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

```
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2]
Explanation: Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4]
Explanation: Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
- `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
- `nums` is sorted in ascending order.

# Valid Mountain Array

Given an array of integers `arr`, return *`true` if and only if it is a valid mountain array*.

Recall that arr is a mountain array if and only if:

- `arr.length >= 3`

- There exists some `i` with `0 < i < arr.length - 1` such that: 

  such that:

  - `arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i] `
  - `arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]`
