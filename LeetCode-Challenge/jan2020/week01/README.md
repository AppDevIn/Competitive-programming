You are given an array of **distinct** integers `arr` and an array of integer arrays `pieces`, where the integers in `pieces` are **distinct**. Your goal is to form `arr` by concatenating the arrays in `pieces` **in any order**. However, you are **not** allowed to reorder the integers in each array `pieces[i]`.

Return `true` *if it is possible* *to form the array* `arr` *from* `pieces`. Otherwise, return `false`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [85], pieces = [[85]]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [15,88], pieces = [[88],[15]]
Output: true
Explanation: Concatenate [15] then [88]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: arr = [49,18,16], pieces = [[16,18,49]]
Output: false
Explanation: Even though the numbers match, we cannot reorder pieces[0].
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: arr = [91,4,64,78], pieces = [[78],[4,64],[91]]
Output: true
Explanation: Concatenate [91] then [4,64] then [78]
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: arr = [1,3,5,7], pieces = [[2,4,6,8]]
Output: false
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= pieces.length <= arr.length <= 100`
- `sum(pieces[i].length) == arr.length`
- `1 <= pieces[i].length <= arr.length`
- `1 <= arr[i], pieces[i][j] <= 100`
- The integers in `arr` are **distinct**.
- The integers in `pieces` are **distinct** (i.e., If we flatten pieces in a 1D array, all the integers in this array are distinct).

Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a **sorted** list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/merge_ex1.jpg)

```
Input: l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: l1 = [], l2 = []
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: l1 = [], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in both lists is in the range `[0, 50]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- Both `l1` and `l2` are sorted in **non-decreasing** order.



##  Jan 5

Given the `head` of a sorted linked list, *delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list*. Return *the linked list **sorted** as well*.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/04/linkedlist1.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5]
Output: [1,2,5]
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/04/linkedlist2.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,1,1,2,3]
Output: [2,3]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 300]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- The list is guaranteed to be **sorted** in ascending order.
